# Image- Classification model Analysis

    Keras is high-level deep learning API.
    Used Keras to build and train neural network to perform image classification.
    Keras runs on top of TensorFlow.
    Used the nueral network which assign weights and biases to various aspects/objects of the image and be able to differentiate one from other.
		
# Input data
    To train a neural network, training data used is Kaggle Cat and Dog dataset.
